Hi there! My name is Zihang Wang. I am a MASc. student in Instrumentation Science and Technology at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I joined the [Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing and Control of Moving Vehicles](https://kjc.seu.edu.cn/jbyjy/31017/list.htm) at Southeast University in 2024, and my supervisor is [Prof. Xu Li](https://ins.seu.edu.cn/lx/list.htm).

In addition, during my undergraduate years at [Jiangsu University of Science and Techonology](https://www.just.edu.cn/), I joined the Robotics Ubiquitous Perception and Cooperative Control Laboratory in 2022, and my supervisor was [Prof. Qiang Zhang](https://mypage.just.edu.cn/dzxx/zq/list.htm). Besides, I joined the [HLL Robotics Lab](https://github.com/JUST-HLL-RoboMaster-Team) in 2021, where I am responsible for research related to robot perception algorithms.

My research interests lie in intelligent vehicle perception and joint localization of multiple intelligences. Specifically, I am exploring several intelligent vehicle multi-sensor fusion schemes in the areas of visual perception, satellite-denied localization schemes, and 6-DoF pose estimation.
