Hi there! My name is Zihang Wang. I am a MASc. student in Instrumentation Science and Technology at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). I joined the [Laboratory of Intelligent Sensing and Control of Moving Vehicles](https://kjc.seu.edu.cn/jbyjy/31017/list.htm) at Southeast University in 2024, and my supervisor is [Prof. Xu Li](https://ins.seu.edu.cn/lx/list.htm).

My research interests lie in intelligent vehicle perception and joint localization of multiple intelligences. Specifically, I am exploring several intelligent vehicle multi-sensor fusion schemes in the areas of visual perception, satellite-denied localization schemes, and 6-DoF pose estimation.
